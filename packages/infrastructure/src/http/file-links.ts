/** The temp-file-link download surface.

 * so this route must never consult the session cookie or bearer header. That
 * is the whole point -- an agent can hand the URL to a tool, a person, or
 * another service without also handing over its API key.
 *
 * Every failure mode -- unknown token, expired, revoked, exhausted, missing
 * blob, or an unexpected storage error -- collapses to the same 404, so a
 * caller can never distinguish "wrong token" from "no such link" and cannot
 * probe for valid tokens. */
