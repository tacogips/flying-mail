/**
 * The mail and admin half of the mailcal GraphQL schema, mirroring
 * `design-docs/specs/design-graphql-api.md#schema`.
 *
 * This document owns `Query` and `Mutation`; the feature modules
 * (`schema-contacts.graphql.ts`, `schema-external-mail.graphql.ts`, and
 * `schema-templates.graphql.ts`) `extend` them, and `schema.ts` merges the
 * documents through `createSchema`. The split
 * exists because a single document had reached the repository's 1000-line
 * ceiling -- see `.agents/skills/ts-coding-standards`.
 *
 * The admin user-management surface stays here in full, including template
 * capabilities and its permission type and mutations.
