# Deployment

## Cloudflare resources

| Resource | Created with | Binding |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| D1 database `mailcal-db` | `wrangler d1 create mailcal-db` | `DB` |
| R2 bucket `mailcal-mail` | `wrangler r2 bucket create mailcal-mail` | `BLOB` |
| Email send binding | `[[send_email]]` in `wrangler.toml` | `EMAIL` |
| Static assets | `[assets]` pointing at `apps/web/dist` | `ASSETS` |

A **Workers Paid plan** ($5/month) is required: Email Routing to a Worker plus
Cloudflare Email Service sending are not available on the free tier at the
volumes this project targets, and R2 + D1 usage beyond the free allowance is
billed there too.

## wrangler.toml

```toml
name = "mailcal-api"
main = "src/worker.ts"
compatibility_date = "2026-08-23"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "mailcal-db"
database_id = "<set after wrangler d1 create>"

[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "BLOB"
bucket_name = "mailcal-mail"

[[send_email]]
name = "EMAIL"

[assets]
directory = "../web/dist"
binding = "ASSETS"
not_found_handling = "single-page-application"
# Note: the asset server answers matching requests *before* the Worker runs,
# so `http/security-headers.ts` never sees them. The SPA's security headers
# are therefore declared in `apps/web/public/_headers`, which vite copies
# into the bundle.

[vars]
MAILCAL_PUBLIC_ORIGIN = "https://mailcal-api.<account>.workers.dev"
# MAILCAL_MAIL_FROM = "postmaster@example.com"
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| `MAILCAL_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` | for login + file links | - | Absolute origin used to build login and file-link URLs. Must match the deployed hostname, or links point at the wrong host. Unset disables passwordless login rather than generating broken links; set-but-invalid fails deployment fast. |
| `MAILCAL_MAIL_FROM` | for login mail | - | Verified sender used for system mail (login links). |
| `MAILCAL_SIGNUP` | no | `closed` | `open` allows self-service signup. Defaults closed because this is a mail server. |
| `MAILCAL_SPAM_THRESHOLD` | no | `0.6` | Score at or above which the `SPAM` tag is applied. |
| `MAILCAL_FILE_LINK_MAX_TTL` | no | `604800` | Cap, in seconds, on `ttlSeconds` for file links. |
| `MAILCAL_BLOB_BACKEND` | no | `r2` | `r2` \| `s3` \| `memory`. |
| `MAILCAL_S3_*` | if `s3` | - | `ENDPOINT`, `BUCKET`, `ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `REGION`. |
| `MAILCAL_SQLITE_URL` | local only | `file:./data/mailcal.db` | libsql location for the Bun/Node server. A bare filesystem path is accepted and promoted to a `file:` URL. |

Secrets go through `wrangler secret put`, never into `wrangler.toml`. Local
secret-dependent commands run under `kinko exec`.

## Bring-up order

1. `mise install && bun install`
2. `wrangler d1 create mailcal-db` and `wrangler r2 bucket create mailcal-mail`;
   paste the database id into `wrangler.toml`.
3. `mise run build-web` then `mise run cf-deploy` (applies remote migrations,
   then deploys).
4. Add the mail domain to Cloudflare and enable **Email Routing** on it.
5. Create a catch-all Email Routing rule that delivers to the `mailcal-api`
   Worker.
6. Verify the domain for **sending** under Email Service, then set
   `MAILCAL_MAIL_FROM`.
7. Bootstrap the instance. A deployed Worker has no shell, and passwordless
   login needs a verified sending domain that only an authenticated admin
   can add -- so `bootstrapAdmin` returns a full-capability API key along
   with the user. It succeeds only while the instance has no users at all,
   and is permanently closed afterwards. **Store the secret; it is shown
   once.**

   ```bash
   curl -sX POST https://<worker-host>/graphql \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"query":"mutation { bootstrapAdmin(email: \"you@example.com\", name: \"You\") { secret apiKey { keyPrefix } user { email } } }"}'
   ```

8. Using that key, `createDomain` + `verifyDomain` through GraphQL, the CLI,
   or the settings UI, so flying-mail itself will accept mail for the domain.
9. Issue narrowly scoped API keys for agents, and revoke the bootstrap key
   once they exist -- it is unrestricted by design and is only needed for
   the setup above.

## Local development

```
mise run dev        # API (Bun, libsql file) + web (vite) together
mise run cf-dev     # wrangler dev, Workers runtime with local D1/R2 simulators
```

The local server applies pending `apps/api/migrations/*.sql` on startup
through the adapter's migration runner before serving a single request, so a
clean checkout is usable immediately. Inbound mail cannot be exercised against
a local SMTP path; `apps/api` exposes a dev-only `POST /dev/inbound` route
(registered only when `graphiql` is enabled) that feeds a raw `.eml` fixture
through the identical ingest use case.
