# Web Mail Client

`apps/web` is a SolidJS single-page mail client built with Vite. It is a plain
consumer of the same `/graphql` endpoint agents use -- it has no privileged
API of its own -- and is served two ways:

1. Bundled into the Worker as static assets (`[assets] binding = "ASSETS"`),
   so a deployment is self-contained at `https://<worker-host>/`.
2. Locally by `flying-mail client serve`, which serves the built bundle and proxies
   `/graphql`, `/api` and `/files` to a configured remote endpoint. See
   `command.md`.

## Stack

| Concern | Choice |
|---------|--------|
| Framework | `solid-js` |
| Routing | `@solidjs/router` |
| GraphQL | a ~250-line `fetch` wrapper; no Apollo/urql |
| HTML mail rendering | `dompurify` sanitize into a sandboxed iframe |
| Styling | Plain CSS with design tokens; one `.css` file per component |

State lives in a single `AppStore` built from Solid signals and stores,
created once in `app.tsx` and read through a context, mirroring the reference
project's `store/app-store.ts` split into `-documents` and `-helpers` files to
keep each under the 1000-line limit.

## Routes

| Path | Guard | View |
|------|-------|------|
| `/login` | public | Passwordless email request; renders the Turnstile widget when `publicConfig.turnstileSiteKey` is non-null (design-security-model.md section 5.4) |
| `/auth/verify` | public | Consumes the emailed token (login or invitation), establishes the session |
| `/` | auth | Mailbox: message list for the selected domain/address |
| `/threads/:id` | auth | Thread view with per-message expansion |
| `/messages/:id` | auth | Single message detail |
| `/compose` | auth | Compose / reply |
| `/search` | auth | Filter-driven search results |
| `/settings/domains` | admin | Domain list, add, DNS records, verify |
| `/settings/api-keys` | admin | Key list, issue with a scope builder, revoke |
| `/settings/users` | admin | "Invite user", invitation status (pending/active), resend invitation, roles, activation, address/domain permissions |
| `/settings/tags` | auth | User tag management |

## Login page clarity

The public `/login` page must identify itself with a prominent “Log in to
flying-mail” heading and a short explanation that signing in opens the mail
inbox to read and send email. Display the product name separately from the
login heading. Before the email field, explain that users enter the email
address associated with their account and receive a one-time login link;
no password is needed. Associate this guidance with the email input for
assistive technology.

After a successful request, show “Check your email” and explain that, if
an account exists for that address, a sign-in link is on its way. Keep the
15-minute expiry and single-use guidance, and suggest checking spam. The
heading and introductory context remain visible in this state. Preserve
all existing authentication and Turnstile behavior and account privacy.
Use the existing visual tokens and keep the card readable on small screens.

## Key components

| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| `app-shell` | Sidebar + topbar + routed outlet |
| `mailbox-sidebar` | Domains, addresses, system tags (Inbox/Starred/Spam/Trash), user tags |
| `message-list` | Virtualized keyset-paginated list; multi-select for bulk actions |
| `message-view` | Headers, body, attachment tiles, tag chips, spam banner |
| `html-body-frame` | Sanitized HTML rendered in a `sandbox`ed iframe; remote images blocked until the reader opts in |
| `compose-form` | From-address picker (scoped), recipients, subject, body, attachment upload |
| `tag-picker` | Add/remove tags, create a new tag inline |
| `attachment-tile` | Download, or "copy temp link" via `createAttachmentLink` |
| `domain-form` / `dns-record-table` | Add a domain and show the records to publish |
| `api-key-form` / `scope-builder` | Capability + domain + address-pattern rows; shows the secret once, with a copy button and an explicit "you will not see this again" warning |
| `user-permission-editor` | Role selector plus allow/deny domain and exact-address assignments |
| `spam-banner` | "Marked as spam (score 0.82)" with a one-click **Not spam** |

## Search syntax

The search box speaks a small operator syntax (`lib/search-query.ts`), so a
single input covers every filter dimension without a filter-builder UI:

| Operator | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `from:addr` | Sender |
| `to:addr` | Recipient, cc **not** included |
| `cc:addr` / `recipient:addr` | Recipient, cc/bcc included |
| `has:attachment` / `no:attachment` | Attachment presence |
| `kind:pdf` / `kind:pdf,image` | Attachment kind, repeatable |
| `tag:Name` / `tag:"With Spaces"` | Tag by name, resolved client-side |
| `is:unread` | Unread only |
| `in:spam` | Include spam explicitly |
| anything else | Full text over subject, snippet and body |

Unknown operators and unresolved tag names fall back to free text rather
than erroring: a search box that rejects input is worse than one that
searches for it.

## Behaviors worth stating

- **HTML mail is hostile input.** Bodies are sanitized with DOMPurify *and*
  rendered inside a `sandbox` iframe with no `allow-same-origin`, so even a
  sanitizer bypass cannot reach the session cookie. Remote images are stripped
  until the reader clicks "load images", which prevents tracking pixels from
  firing on open.
- **Spam is hidden by default** in every list except the Spam view, matching
  the API's `includeSpam: false` default.
- **The secret is shown once.** `createApiKey` returns it in the mutation
  response; the client holds it in a signal that is cleared on navigation and
  never written to `localStorage`.
- **Compose respects scope.** The from-address picker is populated from the
  viewer's `MAIL_SEND` scopes, so a scoped user cannot compose a send that the
  server will reject.
- **Optimistic tagging.** Tag and read/unread toggles update the store
  immediately and roll back on error with a toast, because those mutations are
  frequent and individually cheap.

## Live updates (2026-10-08)

The full design is `design-realtime-push.md` section 10.3.

**Subscription**
- One `mailEvents` subscription per signed-in tab, via
  `@flying-mail/realtime-client`.
- The store integration lives in `store/app-store-live.ts`.

**Events**
- Patch loaded rows and the open message in place, or remove them.
- Schedule a debounced refetch of the visible first page, the
  `addressActivity` counts (unread, rail badges, recent addresses) and the
  inbox unread count.

**Catch-up**
- Every `LIVE` event triggers the catch-up refresh: on first connect,
  after a reconnect, and after `RESYNC_REQUIRED`.

**Connection indicator**
- A connection indicator in the sidebar header shows Live, Reconnecting or
  Offline.
- Under `flying-mail client serve` the indicator shows Offline (no
  WebSocket proxying), and the app behaves as before.

**Local development**
- `vite.config.ts` proxies `/graphql` with `ws: true`.

## Webmail completion (updated 2026-10-07)

See `design-webmail-completion.md` section 7.

**Compose**
- Gains Bcc, a pattern-aware From picker, and a dependency-free
  contenteditable HTML editor with a derived plain-text alternative.
- Attachment chips show progress and can be removed. Forwarded attachments
  are included.
- Debounced, serialized autosave never delivers. Discard calls
  `deleteDraft`.

**Reply, reply-all and forward**
- Prefill comes from the `composeFromMessage` query.

**Sidebar**
- The sidebar becomes folder x scope: domain or mailbox from
  `viewer.readableAddresses`.

**Received mail**
- Correction to "Behaviors worth stating": the HTML frame uses
  `sandbox="allow-same-origin"` without `allow-scripts`, so the parent can
  measure height. Script execution is impossible, and the CSP is
  `default-src 'none'`, so the boundary is no scripts plus no network rather
  than origin isolation.
